    Farewell, Andy!
  </h1>

  <h4 class="title">Thanks for all your contributions to GH and to Portal!</h4>
  <p>A Technical leader yet a team player<br>
    Brings teams together but knows when to split in squads<br>
    <br>
    A Great planner yet highly flexible<br>
    Flexible but knows when to be inflexible<br>
    <br>
    A Perfect Decision maker yet open to hear<br>
    Hears more but knows exactly when to speak up<br>
    <br>
    An Effective Delegator of work yet hands-on<br>
    Not just hands-on DEV but also hands-on PM and SQA<br>
    <br>
    A Great People Manager yet so easy going<br>
    Easy going but knows when to tighten up things<br>
    <br>
    A Friday team lunch planner and initiator<br>
    Initiates but leaves sharp on time and does not wait for latecomers<br>
    <br>
    Andy, a special Engineering Manager of the GH Portal team!!</p>
